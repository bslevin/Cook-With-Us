          <h3>The chef</h3>
          <p>
            Sandra Helena is a Spanish chef and restaurateur. She became a chef in 1997, working at the restaurant
            Roanne, with Claude Troisgros and Emmanuel Bassoleil. She has interned at the restaurants Sadler, in Italy
            and El Celler de Can Roca, in Spain. She decided in 2006, with her husband Daniel Redondo and associates, to
            open the restaurant La Brava.

            La Brava restaurant won its first Michelin Star in 2011 and second in 2016. Their restaurant has been placed
            on "The Worlds Best Restaurant List" since 2014. It is a must-visit restaurant for visitors to Bilbao.

            Most recently, Sandra was a guest chef on the Netflix "Chef Table" series, sitting alongside Europe's top
            chefs and noticeably belonging at the table.

          <h3>Our kitchen</h3>
          <p>
            Our kitchen was purpose built on Sandra's family estate in Northern Spain. The estate has been in the family
            since 1940 and here, with her grandmother, Sandra began to learn to cook. Sandra's youth was immersed in
            agriculture and family meals, a big part of forming who she is today.

            Apart from the cooking school, her brother runs the wine orchard on the property. They produce a wine
            called, Txakoli, unique to the Bizikaia region. Also on the property, Sandra has an active green house,
            where most of the produce used in their restaurant is grown.

            <h3>Italian</h3>
            <p>
              It is the first course beginning in spring, as the green house starts to produce. Sandra believes it is
              essential to learn the use of herbs and Italian flavours are essential for any person wishing to enter a
              professional kitchen environment.

            <h3>Spanish</h3>
            <p>
              Sandra's cooking heritage and flair is on full display. You learn and watch her plan menus, whilst
              organising the ingredients. You meet the farmer of the estate and gain insight into how a chef and their
              ingredients are crucial to each other's performance.

            <h3>French</h3>
            <p>
              The Basque region runs from Bilbao in Spain, through the Pyrenees, to Bayonne in France. Obviously, why
              are so many Michelin-star restaurants located in such a small area. The surrounding area is full of
              hazelnut and walnut trees, undoubtedly finding their way into the cuisine. You learn how Autumn is a
              different, more exquisite cooking tradition.

          <h3>What we offer</h3>
          <p>
            Three separate courses, each running for 12 weeks. With the aim of involving students in the food traditions
            journey. You learn the planning of menus, how having alternative menus in mind is art.
            Our environment is that of a busy kitchen but, with more room to ask and learn. While each day's menu is
            cooked to be served on the farm to employees and guests. Sandra believes food creates the atmosphere that
            brings people
            together. <br>
            The course has a capacity of 6 trainee chefs. On the 3rd week, pairs will alternate in the
            Michelin-Star restaurant.
